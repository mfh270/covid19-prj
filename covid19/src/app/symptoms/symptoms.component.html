    When anyone is affected by this virus, it doesn't make you sudden sick. But
    if your immune system is healthy, then our efforts is to get rid of this. If
    your immunity is high, then there are fewer chances to get affected by the
    virus. For example, our immune system raises our body temperature to make it
    hotter to kill these viruses.

    Everyone's body is different, so the symptoms are caused by our immune
    system, not by the virus itself. Different people have different symptoms

    sick person coughs or sneezes in front of others. The coronavirus can impact
    us if any affected person sneezes or coughs on other people or things. The
    virus can also harm us if the infected person have coughed or sneezed on a
    surface (like a door handle, balcony grill), and we touch the particular
    surface or the person's hand. The droplets of the infected person infects
    our hands and the viruses is transferred through our nose, eyes, or mouth
    into our body.
