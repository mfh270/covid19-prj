        Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
        coronavirus 2. The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei
        province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. Common symptoms
        include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore
        throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.</h3>

    <h3 class="text-style">The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five
        days but may range from two to fourteen days. While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress
        to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure. As of 5th August 2020, more than 1,84,45,787 cases have been
        reported across 185 countries and territories, resulting in more than 6,91,740 deaths. More than 1,10,36,083 0
        people have recovered.
