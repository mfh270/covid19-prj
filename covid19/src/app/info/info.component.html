        coronavirus 2. The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei
        province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic. Common symptoms
        include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore
        throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.</h3>
